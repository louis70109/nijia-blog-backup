I wrote dynamic programming language from working to now. Most of my time also use `print`(Python), `console.log`(JS), `puts`(Ruby) to debug any scripts or web apps. from my before experience, I only know Ruby had `byebug` package which could write a `byebug` line in your code and run it, it will show something information that you could debug in the terminal. 

> This is my first know debug method in dynamic languages ... XD

In this article, I will take you to know how to debug Python apps by Pycharm which was I learn recently...😆
